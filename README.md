# 2Ks Data Analysis
## Introduction
This is a personal project where I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a company's customer delivery data with the purpose of gaining insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the company's delivery processes. The primary objective was to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement to enhance overall customer satisfaction. 
The project answered the following business questions:

- Which zip code has the most orders?
- What was the ratio of one-time customers to returning customers?
- What was the average delivery time for one-time customers vs returning customers?
- What was the average deliery time across zip codes and in each month?
- Which warehouse had the most orders in each zip code?
- Did orders increase or decrease each month across zip codes?
- Which season had the fastest deliveries?
- Which warehouse had the fastest deliveries?
